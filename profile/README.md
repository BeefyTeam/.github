> Abstract

Consumption of beef in Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country in Southeast Asia, continues to increase every year, but there is still low-quality beef on the market which is a challenge for the community in sorting halal beef for consumption, thus increasing the risk of disease from related bacteria such as salmonella. , E. coli, and others. In this case, an application that can monitor and control the quality of circulating beef can be an effective solution to implement from time to time. Introducing, “Beefy” is an application that allows users to analyze and detect the quality, type and shelf life of beef based on the qualitative percentage of the detection results. By using this application, the people of Indonesia can obtain more accurate and objective information regarding the quality of the beef to be consumed. It is also hoped that this will help the public in making the right decisions regarding purchasing beef consumption, as well as increase confidence in marketed beef products.
